= Introduction =

RSDB supported the mostly used types of data. You can see the list below.


= Details =

|| *Type* || *Description* ||
|| `text` || Holds an unlimited length Unicode text. When used, it must be always surrounded by double quotes. ||
|| `number` || Holds a variable precision number. ||
|| `string` || Holds a fixed-size Unicode text. _(Default is 256.)_ ||
|| `md5` || Holds an 128 bits (16 bytes) MD5 sum. ||
|| `boolean` || Holds a value that can vary between `false` and `true`. ||
|| `list` || Holds a list of constant string values. ||

= Description =

== `text` data type ==

This type is always 16-bits Unicode. But it can be stored as an 8-bits Unicode if the text is ASCII-only. There is no limit for the length of the content of a `text` field.

== `number` data type ==

The `number` type stores multi-type multi-precision numbers, like naturals (42), float-point numbers (0.042), hexadecimals (42h), octals(42o), binaries (101010b) and even scientific notated numbers (2.2+45e).

== `string` data type ==
== `md5` data type ==
== `boolean` data type ==
== `list` data type ==
