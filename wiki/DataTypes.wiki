= Introduction =

RSDB supported the mostly used types of data. You can see the list below.


= Details =

|| *Type* || *Description* ||
|| `text` || Holds an unlimited length Unicode text. When used, it must be always surrounded by double quotes. ||
|| `number` || Holds a variable precision number. ||
|| `string` || Holds a fixed-size Unicode text. _(Default is 256.)_ ||
|| `md5` || Holds an 128 bits (16 bytes) MD5 sum. ||
|| `boolean` || Holds a value that can vary between `false` and `true`. ||
|| `list` || Holds a list of constant string values. ||

= Description =

== `text` data type ==

This type is always 16-bit Unicode. But it can be stored as an 8-bits Unicode if the text is ASCII-only. There is no limit for the length of the content of a `text` field.

== `number` data type ==

The `number` type stores multi-type multi-precision numbers, like naturals (42), float-point numbers (0.042), hexadecimals (42h), octals(42o), binaries (101010b) and even scientific notated numbers (2.2+45e).

== `string` data type ==

A fixed-length version of `text` type. The diference between `string` and `text` type is the optmization arround de code, make `string` faster to read and manipulate than `text`. By default, the maximum size that `string`type can hold is 256 Unicode characters in the 16-bit format. But you can declare an arbitrary size for the field put it between parenthesis. By example:

{{{
table mytable
{
    name: string;
    description: string(2048);
}
}}}

In the example above, `name` can hold a string with a maximum size of 256 characters, and `description` can hold a maximum string of 2048 characters. The maximum length that can be declared for a `string` field is 4294967295 characters (about 4 gigabytes.) The minimum length is 1.
